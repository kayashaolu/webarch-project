# Project
Build something awesome

## For this project you will accomplish the following
 - Build an application of your choosing with 2-4 other teammembers
 - Learn how to collaborate to build a single application
 - Show off your skills
 
## The project is split into two parts
  - Part I: Defining your project and building your teams
  - Part II: Implementing your project idea, presenting to the class, and writing about it

## Each team of 3-5 people (non-negotiable, no single/dual projects) must complete the following:
 - Think of an web application that they would like to build
 - Build the web application that they came up with
  - It can use any number of external APIs (like the Twitter API) in the applcation. This is strongly encouraged.
 - Deploy the web application to the cloud
 - Demo the web application and present it to the rest of the class **without any slides**
 - Submit a write up that consists of a description of the web application that was built
 
## First step is to split into teams of 3-5 and come up with a project idea
 - There are NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule. Each team must have at least 3 people. If need be I will form teams.
 - Each team needs to come up with the web application that they would like to build. Here are some examples:
  - A reminder application that allows you to save reminders for a later period of time
  - A web application that uses the Twitter API to save nad display tweets related to a topic of the user's choosing
  - A web application that uses the Spotify API to play songs that it thinks the user would like
 - We will take a look at initial drafts of the web applicaiton that you have choosen to build and comment on the feasibility of your project idea and return with comments
 
## Second step is to build your application
 - Each team will have one repository where they will push their changes
 - This could be the first time you were not the only commmiters in your own repository. Beware of merge conflicts and editing the same file with someone else
 - git pull often
 
## Third step is to deploy your application
 - All projects must be available on the internet
 - Must deploy your NodeJS server to the web
 
## Fourth step is to prepare and deliver for your presentation
 - Please note: presentations in this class are demo's of the actual web application, not slides
 - **There will be a 15 point deduction of the project grade if slides are used in the presentation***
 
## Fifth step: commit all changes in repo and write a paper on what you did and name it LEARNINGS.md
 - LEARNINGS.md should contain the following:
  - A description of what your project does
  - A description of what to do during the holiday season
